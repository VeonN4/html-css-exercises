    <b>Recently</b>, the high-end EV world has become a Nurburgring arms race with Prsche and Tesla vying for the best lap at the farmed circuit. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/26/porsche-taycan-nurburgring-record/">Taycan set a record</a> and <font color="red">Tesla</font>
    <u>CEO</u> Elon Musk decided that the Model S would best it. From early reports, the <a href="http://youtbe.com">Fremont company did just that</a> with a heavily modified vehicle.
    <br><br>
    Ahead of the Tesla run, I sat down with Porsche's Nort America <u>CEO</u>, Klaus Zellmar, to talk rivalries, where the <font color="green"><u><i>Taycan</i></u></font> sits in the EV world and the surprisingdemographics it's gathered from its subcription service.
    <br><br>
    <i>"Many people are talking about competition and all that. We love competition. We come from
      the racetrack. The Nurburgring; we love that environment. But first and foremost, we want to
      present an alternative, carrying the badge Porsche and the brand promise -- to everything that
      is electric out there right now." Zellmer said</i>

    Apple never showed intentions of racing the <b>Nexus 7</b> to the bottom in the tablet game, and the
    <b>iPhone 5</b>c is proof that it won't do that in the phone arena, either.<br>
