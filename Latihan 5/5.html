    <p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to transform an HTML list into a wall of "sticky
        notes" that look and work like the following:
    </p>
    <p>The effect is built up gradually and works on all up-to-date browsers like
        Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Opera. Older browsers simply get some yellow
        squares.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Step 1: The HTML and Basic Squares
            <br><br>
            We will be using some common CSS properties that work across all
browsers. As we are using HTML5 for the effect, the basic HTML of our
sticky notes is an unordered list with a link containing all the other
<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 2: Drop Shadows and Scribbly Font
            <br><br>
            Now it's time to add a drop shadow to the notes to make them stand out and
to use a scribbly, hand-written font as the note font. For this we use <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>
 and the fonts they provide us with, called "Reenie Beanie" and "Lato".
 <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 3: Tilting the Notes
            <br><br>
            Both the tilting of the notes and the zooming we'll add in the next step were
            already explained in the past, <a href="https://www.zurb.com/playground/css3-polaroids">in this article by Zurb.</a> So big thanks to them
            for publishing this trick.
            <br><br>
            In order to tilt an element, you use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-2d-transforms/"><code>transform:rotate</code> property of CSS3</a>,
again adding the prefix for each of the browsers:
        </li>
    </ol>
