      <h1>Apple's iPhone 5c isn't the low-cost phone you've been
        waiting for</h1>

    <p><b>The iPhone 5c</b>, simply put, is for those who've grown numb to Apple's largely evolutionary
      takes on its primary iPhone range. It'll attract a younger audience that cares less about finely
      beveled edges and more about playing <i><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/10/iphone-5s-and-5c-cases/">Connect 4 on their iPhone case</a></i>. It'll cater to the same
      <font color="green"><i>crowd that has looked</i></font> longingly towards the $599 (again, off-contract) <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/08/05/motorola-moto-x-review/">Moto X</a> -- a phone for the
      mainstream, and a phone that's as colorful as one's soul. In a way, this is the anti-Moto X. From a
      price, spec and feature perspective, it's a match that's too close to call. The iPhone 5c's camera
      <font color="red">has</font> an edge on the <font color="red"><b>Moto X</b></font>, but the X's Active Display is a boon for notifications. As these things
      tend to go, a lot of it boils down to ecosystem preference. The iPhone 5c is being built for the
      same audience as the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/07/ipod-nano-review-2010/">flashy iPod nano</a>, and moreover, Apple built it for those on <u>Wall Street</u>
      who feel that it simply must attract new markets to stay atop its game.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Apple never showed intentions of racing the <u><b>Nexus 7</b></u> to the bottom in the tablet game, and the
        iPhone 5c is proof that it won't do that in the phone arena, either.</p>
